# ECT Mobile Deployment	

## Prepare to Depart	

### Initial Arrival	

* Remove padlocks from side and back door (replace prior to transport).

* Open doors (side and back)

* Remove tire covers and stow (day trip: in shed; multi-day: in trailer)

* Ensure mast over-pressure valve is locked in open or "bleed" position.

>[!NOTE]
> Valve is located on mast base; if ring is horizontal, pull and turn 90* to vertical position Inside ECT, aft port side, locate carpet covered air system enclosure

* Ensure air resevoir valve at base of tank is closed (knob horizontal).

* Locate floor mounted access panel under tank and remove any cables from ECT.

* Ensure mast control valve is in "neutral" position (inside).

>[!TIP]
> Valve box is white, located on right side of enclosure; black handle is valve control

* Open door above air tank, and fill air resevoir by operating black toggle switch.

* Obtain combination tire air fill / pressure gauge from black tool bag, and check tire pressure.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>	If not 65 psi, use on-board air to fill tires as necessary

* Turn compressors OFF with togggle switch after cycling off.

* At front of ECT, check diesel fuel quantity in auxillary containers.

* ECT fuel level. Inside ECT, locate "wall type light switch" on right side of genset panel and turn "ON". Instrument lights will illuminate, and fuel gauge will indicate fuel level.

* If time allows, install any needed Windows, Winlink, etc. updates.
	
### Power: AC / Shore Power	

* Turn all circuit breakers OFF. Panel is located under front desk top.

* Remove 50A plug from wall receptacle on building, and hang on gray box

* Remove 50A (gray) twist-lock receptacle from ECT wall mounted plug.
