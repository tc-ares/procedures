This net meets every Sunday night at 1900 local time on this 147.360 MHz repeater.

ARES operates on the repeater with the permission of its owner.

The repeater requires an input tone of 131.8 Hz. Without that tone, it will not repeat your transmission.

The backup repeater frequency is 146.940 MHz with an input tone of 107.2 Hz.

A simplex frequency of 146.580 MHz with no tone will be used when needed.

Program these frequencies into your radio as the net may switch at any time.

In an emergency, tune to the resource and information net on the 147.360 MHz repeater.

During a weather event, tune to the Skywarn and Information Net on the 146.940 MHz repeater.

The Amateur Radio Emergency Service, or “ARES,” is a part of the field organization of the ARRL.

The purpose of the net is for training and the dissemination of relevant information.

ARES promotes public service to several agencies through the use of amateur radio.

The agencies we serve operate using the National Incident Command System, ICS for short.

ARES operates under the ARES communication plan and uses the communication resources specified in ARES ICS-217 forms.

All ARES members are encouraged to complete the basic ICS 100, 200, 700, and 800 training.

The TCARES communication plans, local ICS 217 forms, and links to the FEMA ICS training courses can all be found on our [TCARES.org](http://www.tcares.org) website.

Give the prospective new member the [TCARES.org](http://www.tcares.org) webpage address. Information on how to join the groups.io mailing list is under the "About" heading. The STX Depot link has its own heading. Also, invite them to the next ARES general meeting. Don’t change the count if already checked in.

We will begin check-ins shortly.

When checking in, leave a pause between transmissions so that anyone with emergency or priority traffic can be heard.

Stations with emergency or priority traffic should call “BREAK” at any time, and net control will respond.

When you check in, please stay until released. If you must leave the net, please notify net control.

When checking in, please use only ITU phonetics, and saying “This is” is not necessary.

_Check with your backup periodically to verify the count._

Let’s take a pause from check-ins.

TCARES meets on the fourth Tuesday of each month. These meetings are at 1930 local time on Zoom. Meeting links are sent out on our groups.io mailing list.

A digital Winlink net is held each week. Find details on the TCARES.org website under the "Nets" heading. All ARES operators are encouraged to use Winlink Express by both radio and Telnet.

This is the last call for check-ins to the Travis County ARES net.

_If no further stations check in, close the net down._

Check-ins are now closed.

_If training came in the form of a question, ask the trainer for the correct answer._

Check with your backup for check-in count, message count, and time.

Thanks to all who participated in this net. This is (call sign) returning the frequency to regular amateur radio use.  

_This should be the last thing spoken for the net._

### Notes

#### Before the net:

Please be on frequency before the net to coordinate with your backup and to perform signal checks.

#### During the net:

Remember to identify using your call sign, at least every 10 minutes.

If conditions are bad on the main frequency, switch to the backup frequencies as needed. When switching, ensure your backup has moved with you before you begin. Repeat the start of the script on the new frequency.

#### During check-ins:

- If there are duplicates, ask the operators to repeat themselves as needed until everyone is checked in. Queue them up using any partial call signs heard, if possible.
- If you hear a phone tone, the user may have Yaesu WIRES turned on. Ask them to turn it off and repeat their check-in.
- If someone just breaks squelch on the repeater but cannot be heard, ask the operator to try:
  1. Moving to a higher location.
  2. Increasing their power.
  3. Switching to an antenna with more gain.
  
Then try to check in again.

Give signal reports to stations that are weak, scratchy, or unclear.

“Short time” operators are asking to leave the net directly after their check-in. The usual responses are, “You are released” or “You are released at your discretion.”
